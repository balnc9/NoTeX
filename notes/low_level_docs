LOW LEVEL DOCUMENTATION
Just some notes to help me fully understand implemetnation

FastAPI implementation:
first, create the FastAPI instance
	app = FastAPI(
		title, description, version, etc. = ????
	)

	This creates you web server - 'app' is your entire backend!
	This will auto-generate documentation. FastAPI creates beautiful API docs for free!
	Sets metadata - title/description should appear in the docs now!

Create API endpoints
	@app.get("/")                # HTTP GET request to root URL
	async def read_root():       # Function name doesnt matter, just for good design
		return { "message..." }    # FastAPI automatically converts to JSON
	
	@app.get("/path") - this is a decorator that tells FastAPI "when someone visits /path, run this"
	async def - Non blocking function (server can simultaneously handle other requests whle this runs)
	Return dict/object - FastAPI automatically converts to JSON response
